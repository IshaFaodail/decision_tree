Advanced Decision Tree Techniques and Ensemble Learning: Implementation and Visualization
• Implemented algorithm on two-class (XOR), three-class (concentric circles, balanced and unbalanced spirals), and
five-class (balanced and unbalanced spirals) datasets.
• Achieved high accuracy: 1 for XOR, 0.98 for concentric circles, 0.93 (decision tree) and 0.95 (random forest) for
balanced/unbalanced spirals, indicating robust performance across datasets.
• With escalating class complexity, random forest exhibits superior performance over decision tree, demonstrating
heightened accuracy and robustness.
